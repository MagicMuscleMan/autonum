See http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
----------------------------------------------------------------

This is the autonum package, automatically numbering only the equations which
are referenced.
This package is similar to mathtools' showonlyrefs option, but without
introducing the bug to overwrite long equations with the equation number.

Usage: \usepackage{autonum}

Everything else should happen automatically.
To use autonum together with other packages, load autonum last.

% \section{Introduction}
% With \LaTeX, the user has to decide manually to not number an equation by adding a star in the math environment. Authors who do not want to think about the numbering during writing (and maybe they should not), often use the environments without stars. As default, these users get all equations numbered, although there are \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/29267/7323}{different opinions} about what should be numbered.
%
% The other automatic possibility one can think of is to number only the referenced equations. The \href{http://www.ctan.org/pkg/mh/}{mathtools} package's option \texttt{showonlyrefs} seems to be the solution for those who want to have the referenced equations numbered only. Unfortunately, for \href{http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath}{amsmath} users this also means a step backwards, as the numbering can overwrite parts of the equation according to its documentation. Generally, this options seems to be quite unreliable as it is incompatible with the \href{http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cleveref/}{cleveref} package. The autonum package implements the numbering of referenced equations only without this deficiencies.
%^^A This currently does not work with cleveref, as equations without a number increment the equation counter, too. As placing the labels does not always work correctly, \cmd{\mathtoolsset{showonlyrefs}} is not an option (see mathtools documentation, bottom of page 10).
%
% \section{Usage and Examples}
% To get the automatic numbering of referenced equations, simply load the package:
%
% \vspace{0.5em}
% \cmd{\usepackage\{autonum\}}
% \vspace{0.5em}
%
% This provides support for \cmd{\ref} (and \cmd{\cref} if cleveref is loaded, see section \ref{loadOrder}). If you need support for other reference commands, see section \ref{referenceCommands}. As you probably use the hyperref package, you should set the hypperref option \texttt{hypertexnames=false} when loading the hyperref package to avoid some warnings (see section \ref{hyperref}).
%
% The recommended style is to add a label to each logical equation. Then, simply use the references as needed. Never use the starred forms when defining an equation as they do not make sense with autonum and are deactivated. You can use the (redefined) \texttt{equation} or \cmd{\[}-\cmd{\]}-environment in most cases, if you add the appropriate \cmd{\begin\{split\}}-\cmd{\end\{split\}} pairs when needed. Sometimes, an \texttt{align}, \texttt{multline}, \texttt{gather}, \texttt{flalign} or \texttt{alignat} environment is needed.  Do \href{http://tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/madsen/madsen.pdf}{not use \texttt{eqnarray}}.^^A, rarely use the \texttt{aligned} or \texttt{gathered} environments.
%
% Please keep in mind, that using autonum might not always be a good thing. If you hand-in a paper for review with many equations on a page, you might avoid using autonum or if you do, you probably should reference most of your equations or activate line numbers.
%
%\begin{macro}{equation}
% The following examples show the results of the equation environment after loading the package. Now let's reference the third equation: \ref{alreadyReferenced}.
% \begin{equation}
% 	1 = 1\quad(\text{equation without label})
% \end{equation}
%
% \begin{equation}\label{notReferenced}
% 	2 = 2\quad(\text{equation with label, not referenced})
% \end{equation}
%
% \begin{equation+}\label{alreadyReferenced}
% 	3 = 3\quad(\text{equation with label, already referenced})
% \end{equation+}
%
% \begin{equation+}\label{referencedLater}
% 	4 = 4\quad(\text{equation with label, referenced later})
% \end{equation+}
% Now let's reference the fourth equation: \ref{referencedLater}. The first and the second equations do not get a number, as they are not referenced.
%
% If you want to try an example yourself, you can take this one, where only the first equation gets a number:
%
% \vspace{0.5em}
% \noindent\cmd{\documentclass\{article\}}\\
% \cmd{\usepackage\{autonum\}}\\
% \cmd{\begin\{document\}}\\
% \indent\cmd{\begin\{equation\}}\cmd{\label\{a\}}\\
% \indent\indent \texttt{a}\\
% \indent\cmd{\end\{equation\}}\\
% \indent\cmd{\begin\{equation\}}\cmd{\label\{b\}}\\
% \indent\indent \texttt{b}\\
% \indent\cmd{\end\{equation\}}\\
% \indent\cmd{\ref\{a\}}\\
% \cmd{\end\{document\}}
% \vspace{0.5em}
%
% To get the correct references up to three compilation runs are necessary when the autonum package is used (as always in \TeX\ this cannot be guaranteed, so in rare cases even that is not enough). This is one additional run compared to the default referencing mode, as one run is needed to check if an equation is used. This is probably not avoidable, as the information which equation should have a number is simply not always available in the first run while layouting the equation. Thus, the equation's number can change in the second run. For the reference command, this information is only stable in the third run, as the equations influence each other.
%\end{macro}
%
% \begin{macro}{align et al.}
% Instead of equation you may also use one of the following environments: \texttt{align}, \texttt{gather}, \texttt{multline}, \texttt{flalign}. ^^A, \texttt{aligned}, \texttt{gathered}. ^^A The \texttt{multlined} environment is patched, if it is available.
% The label should be given after the equation but before the newline command, e.g.
%
% \vspace{0.5em}
% \noindent\cmd{\begin\{align\}}\\
% \indent \texttt{a}\cmd{\label\{firstLabel\}}\texttt{\textbackslash\textbackslash}\\
% \indent \texttt{b}\cmd{\label\{secondLabel\}}\\
% \cmd{\end\{align\}}\\
% \vspace{0.5em}
%
% Providing the label at the beginning of an equation's line should work, too, but is less thoroughly tested. Please provide feedback, if you find a non-working constellation, which works if autonum is not loaded.
% \end{macro}

% \begin{macro}{split}
% The split environment should work as expected with one exception. To get correct vertical spacing after a non-referenced split environment, which is embedded into another math environment, autonum must execute code inside of the split environment. To identify the environment, currently the label name is used, which is not available inside of the split environment, if the label is given after the end of the split environment, which is possible without autonum. So as an exception to the rule above, provide the label before the beginning of the split environment when using a split environment to be on the safe side. Providing it inside of the split environment seems to work currently, but is not guaranteed to work in the future. If the label is given too late, autonum prints an error to avoid accidently introducing a spacing or numbering problem. As an example, put the labels as following:
%
% \vspace{0.5em}
% \noindent\cmd{\begin\{align\}}\\
% \indent \cmd{\label\{firstLabel\}}\\
% \indent \cmd{\begin\{split\}}\\
% \indent\indent \texttt{a}\\
% \indent\indent \texttt{\textbackslash\textbackslash}\\
% \indent\indent \texttt{b}\\
% \indent \cmd{\end\{split\}}\\
% \indent \texttt{\textbackslash\textbackslash}\\
% \indent \texttt{c}\cmd{\label\{secondLabel\}}\\
% \cmd{\end\{align\}}\\
% \vspace{0.5em}
%
% \end{macro}

% \begin{macro}{\[ and \]}
% As the commands \cmd{\[} and \cmd{\]} are useless when using autonum, they are redefined to be an alias of \texttt{begin\{equation\}} and \texttt{end\{equation\}}, respectively. ^^A, instead either the \texttt{equation} or the \texttt{align} environments are used, depending on the number of lines in the equation.
% Without adding labels or referencing added labels, the new \cmd{\[}-\cmd{\]}-environment behaves like the old one. ^^A if the equation is only one line. The new definition inherits all the multi-line and alignment capabilities from align and thus is recommended as default while writing. If the environment's content has only one line, the equation environment is used, which has a \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/321/align-vs-equation}{smaller vertical space} for short lines above the environment compared to align.
% \end{macro}
%
%\begin{macro}{equation+}
% In the rare case, that an equation is very important and not references within the text, but some other person wants to reference to that equation, you can use \cmd{\begin\{equation+\}} and \cmd{\end\{equation+\}}. The equation is then numbered in all cases (having a label or not, being referenced or not). This feature has been added, so that all \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/52287}{three referencing practices} are supported in \LaTeX\ with as much automation as possible. The other math environments support a \texttt{+}-variant, too.
%\end{macro}
%
%\begin{macro}{equation*}
% The starred versions have been deleted, to avoid accidental use. Use the versions without star and without adding a label, to avoid that an equation gets a number.
%\end{macro}
%
% \section{Compatibility}
% \subsection{Load Order}\label{loadOrder}
% As other packages might break autonum, it should be loaded very late. Normally, amsmath is loaded automatically to make use of the more advanced math environments. Nevertheless, to use other packages, it might be necessary to load amsmath manually. To use autonum with amsmath, hyperref and cleveref for example, the order must be amsmath $\rightarrow$ hyperref $\rightarrow$ cleveref $\rightarrow$ autonum. If a wrong order has been active, it might be necessary to delete the aux file manually to get rid of compile errors, which is generally a good debugging strategy if autonum is or was involved. The support of autonum without amsmath has been discontinued due to missing demand.
%
% \subsection{Hyperref}\label{hyperref}
% The hyperref package must be loaded with the option \texttt{hypertexnames=false} to work when autonum is used, as in the following example
%
% \vspace{0.5em}\noindent
% \cmd{\usepackage[hypertexnames=false]\{hyperref\}}\\
% \cmd{\usepackage\{autonum\}}
% \vspace{0.5em}
%
% Problem description: Generally, the autonum package is careful not to break other packages, but with autonum there are non-starred mathematical environment which do not increase the equation counter if they are not referenced. This leads to the following warning in hyperref when more than one equation is used: "destination with the same identifier (name{equation.0.1}) has been already used, duplicate ignored".
%
% Additionally, the link anchors do not work correctly (with a reference followed by a labeled equation, there is a warning in tracing mode, too. Hyperref seems to increase \LaTeX's equation's counter (called \texttt{equation}) only if a equation is referenced. This counter may not be modified to avoid problems with Hyperref, as this would change the displayed equation number (and it does not work anyway). This problem is independent of cleveref. The problem might be solvable by modifying \cmd{\begin\{equation\}} or \cmd{\end\{equation\}}. Using \texttt{gather} instead of \texttt{equation} removes the warning, but hyperlinks still do not work.
%
% So it's a mess and probably not worth the time, as \texttt{hypertexnames=false} solves all these problems.
%
% \subsection{Reference commands}\label{referenceCommands}
% As default the \cmd{\ref} and cleveref's \cmd{\cref} commands are supported (the latter one only if the cleveref package is loaded). 
% If you want to add autonum support for other referencing commands, you have the following choices. Please mind that these interfaces might change in the future, as it's unclear what reference commands make sense beyond \cmd{\cref}. Please also mind the \cmd{\makeatletter} and \cmd{\makeatother} command before and after the commands, respectively.
%
%\begin{macro}{\autonum@generatePatchedReference}
% For normal reference commands expecting a single label name as an argument, you can use \cmd{\autonum@generatePatchedReference}\{\texttt{NewReferenceCommand}\}.
%\end{macro}
%
%\begin{macro}{\autonum@generatePatchedReferenceCSL}
% For reference commands expecting a comma separated list of label names as an argument, you can use\\
% \cmd{\autonum@generatePatchedReferenceCSL}\{\texttt{NewReferenceCommand}\}.
%\end{macro}
%
%\begin{macro}{\autonum@generatePatchedReferenceGeneral}
% For reference commands expecting a general data structure containing label names as an argument, you can use\\
% \cmd{\autonum@generatePatchedReferenceGeneral}\{\texttt{NewReferenceCommand}\}\\
% \{\cmd{\SplitAndLoopMacro}\}.\\
% The macro \cmd{\SplitAndLoopMacro} acts as a function expecting the to-be-called function as the first argument and the data structure as the second argument. It must call the function given in the first argument for each label name given in the data structure of the second argument. An example is the \cmd{\forcsvlist} macro from the etoolbox package, which is used to implement \cmd{\autonum@generatePatchedReferenceCSL}.
%\end{macro}
%
%\begin{macro}{\crefrange}
% Range commands like the \cmd{\crefrange} command are not supported at the moment. It's not completely clear, if this is a good or a bad thing. Please contact the package author if you are interested in this feature.
%\end{macro}
%
% Support for new reference command names can be added by executing\\
% \cmd{\let}\cmd{\ref}\cmd{\NewReferenceCommand}.
%
% If the new reference command can have optional arguments, you should probably write instead\\
% \cmd{\LetLtxMacro}\cmd{\ref}\cmd{\NewReferenceCommand}.
%
% If you want to use the power of \cmd{\cref} without getting rid of the habit of writing \cmd{\ref}, you can just add the following code to the preamble
%
% \vspace{0.5em}
% \noindent\cmd{\AfterEndPreamble\{\%}\\
% \indent\cmd{\let}\cmd{\ref}\cmd{\cref}\\
% \texttt{\}\%}
% \vspace{0.5em}
%
% If you also strive for maximum consistency and want to avoid accidently writing \cmd{\cref} or \cmd{\autoref}, you can instead add the following lines
%
% \vspace{0.5em}
% \noindent\cmd{\AfterEndPreamble\{\%}\\
% \indent\cmd{\let}\cmd{\ref}\cmd{\cref}\\
% \indent\cmd{\undef\{}\cmd{\cref\}\%}\\
% \indent\cmd{\undef\{}\cmd{\autoref\}\%}\\
% \texttt{\}\%}
% \vspace{0.5em}
%
%
% \section{Further Ideas}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item For equations with multiple lines, which have a width close to the linewidth, but whose width at the middle/end is not so large, the equation number should not be set below the equation but next to the equation as it is done if the equation is smaller.
% \item A similar approach could be used for figure and table environments to print a warning, if such an environment is not referenced. With the subfig package, the solution would be harder, as a figure or table may be unreferenced, if all subfloats are referenced. Similarly, a subfloat may be unreferenced, if its parent environment is referenced. So the warning should only be printed if an unreferenced parent environment either does not have any child environment or if there is an unreferenced child environment.
% \item A warning could be printed, if another compile is necessary. Sometimes this is the case, but not always.
% \item A "*" could be used instead of a "+".
% \item If a reference is used before the label is defined, the reference information is saved in a variable and can be used later in the current run when processing the label. It does not have to be saved to the aux file. If a reference is used after defining the label, the reference information is saved in the aux file and can be used in the next run when processing the label. The information does not have to be saved into a variable, as a label must only be defined once and the definition has already happened. Unfortunately, this would make it necessary to distinguish between definitions in the current and in the last run, as otherwise this leads either to oscillation or to defining everything in the end (depending if csdefaux or csdefall is used in the not-defined case), which is probably not worth the effort.
% \item The command \cmd{\(} could be an alias for \texttt{begin\{split\}} and \cmd{\)} could be an alias for \texttt{end\{split\}} inside of another math environment, as the \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/510/are-and-preferable-to}{LaTeX math inline syntax} can only occur outside of a math environment.
% \item This \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/5652}{trick} might be handy
% \item The \cmd{\crefrange} might be supported. As this would require a lot of work it will only be done if multiple people show interest and there are really convincing real-world examples where using \cmd{\crefrange} is superior to using \cmd{\cref}. Patches are, of course, welcome, too.
% \item This documentation should be vastly improved from someone who is actually good in writing documentations.

% \section{Implementation}
% The basic idea is to write into the aux file and save a variable whenever a label is referenced, so that the information is available in the current and in the next run. The label information is passed from the label command to the newline command. The newline command uses the label and the reference information to possibly add a \cmd{\notag} command, deciding if it is referenced or not.
%
% ^^A Calling the old newline command leads to a redefinition (overwriting, not patching) of the (current) newline command (proved by using \cmd{\show}\cmd{\\} before and after the call to amsmath's newline command) when using local definitions. As amsmath behaves like a virus then, the patched newline function is only called for the first newline. After the first call, amsmath's hijacked newline is used directly without giving a chance to do something useful. To correct this behavior, the newline command would need to be patched again. Unfortunately, \cmd{\let} cannot be used to save the current command, because the copy generated by \cmd{\let} is deleted by amsmath (WTF?). To avoid all this, some global definitions are used.

% This command is similar to the \cmd{\csxdef} command from the package etoolbox, but instead of defining the command immediately, it is defined in the next run by writing it to the aux file. The name is given by the first argument (which may not have a leading backslash). The second argument is the replacement text. This command would be a candidate for inclusion into etoolbox. \cmd{\ifcsdef} can be used to check, if the command has been defined. See also http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/49035

As \cmd{\renewenvironment} is always local (see http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/51733), the redefinition of the split environment does not work. As the split subcommands are currently neither saved nor patched, it is not only unnecessary, but really harmful to restore the subcommands. Doing so breaks splits together with other material in an align environment. This code should be changed after the root problem has been fixed. Neither delete the label, as it might be defined before the split environment and is used after its end.

If the label is only given after the split (but before the line of the align ends), this is impossible, thus, the label has to be given before the end of the split environment. As split provides not numbering, it's best to provide the label before the beginning of the split environment. To save users, redefine \cmd{\label} to result in an error if the \cmd{\label} is called too late. In the future, this could be changed if equations have another unique identifier like a number. The \cmd{\label} can be overwritten (but mind the optional argument, which must be supported), as the split TeX-group will end directly after this macro. In order to be effective, it must be smuggled outside, which \cmd{\aftergroup@def} from etextools takes care of.
